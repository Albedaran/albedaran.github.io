            <p>It is important to have a motivation - a spark, something to fight for.
            For me, it is <em>kiwi birds</em>. Fragile and on the way to extinction, I do my best to develop softwares and spread awareness of my cause at the same time. <strong>Protect those cuties!</strong></p>

                <h3>About these awesome little creatures</h3>
            </div>
            <p>Kiwi birds are quite small, but that's what makes them especially adorable. These flightless little birds roam the forests peacefully, but due to certain conditions in their surroundings, they almost drifted to the brink of extinction. Luckily, kiwi enthusiast have their backs, and are planning to provide them with necessities, so they can survive and avoid the demise dodo birds have experienced.
                Also, have some boolean knowledge - logic gates to be exact, since the project specified I should put definitions on my page:
                It is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function; that is, it performs a logical operation on one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output. Now, I wanted to link my wiki to KIWI birds, but that's illegal in the terms of this project, so I'll link it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiwi">HERE</a> instead.
